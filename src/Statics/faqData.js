        ques:"Q: Is hand sanitizer effective against COVID-19? ",
        ans:"A: One of the best ways to prevent the spread of infections and decrease the risk of getting sick is by washing your hands with plain soap and water, advises the CDC. Washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is essential, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing, or blowing one’s nose. If soap and water are not available, CDC recommends consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

        ques:"Q: Who is eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine precaution dose?",
        ans:"A:  As of 10th January 2022, Health Care Workers and Front-Line Workers who have received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine are eligible to receive another dose of the vaccine called the precaution dose. All persons aged 60 years and above with comorbidities and who have received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine are eligible to receive the precaution dose based on their doctor’s advice. The order in which these precaution doses would be given are based on the completion of 9 months or 39 weeks from the second dose.",

    {
        ques:"Q: If I have already had COVID-19 and recovered, do I still need to get the COVID-19 vaccine?",
        ans:"A: Yes, you should get a COVID-19 vaccine, even if you’ve had COVID-19. The vaccine will still help in developing a strong immune response against the disease. But wait for 3 months after being infected with COVID-19 before getting the vaccine.",
    },
    {
        ques:"Q: What if I get COVID-19 in between 2 vaccine doses?",
        ans:"A: For most people who have 1 dose of the vaccine, the disease is likely to be mild or moderate, depending on how many days after vaccination the virus exposure happens. If exposure occurs within 1 to 3 weeks of getting the first dose (of Covaxin or Covishield), the vaccine is unlikely to have an effect and is not expected to change the course of the infection. However, if a person tests positive after 3 weeks from their first dose, they are highly likely to only get a mild case of COVID-19. Once a person gets COVID-19, their body starts producing antibodies to it. Therefore, experts suggest waiting 3 months after recovering from COVID-19 before getting the second dose. Getting the second dose is important to ensure an effective immune response against COVID-19 in the future.",
    },
    {
        ques:"Q: Why do I need to get two doses of the vaccine?",
        ans:"A: The first dose helps the body recognize the virus and gets the immune system ready to protect from future infection, while the second dose strengthens that immune response. This makes the body prepared to fight infection.",
    },
    {
        ques:"Q: What is the right timing between COVID-19 vaccine doses?",
        ans:"A: Recent studies have shown that certain time frames between vaccine doses allow for the best immune response. This timing is different for each vaccine. This has to do with the different ways each vaccine works with your body’s immune system. Covishield: Real-world studies of the Covishield vaccine show that waiting a longer time between doses led to a better immune response. So the time between the two doses has been increased to 12-16 weeks. Covaxin: Scientists recommend that the second dose of the Covaxin vaccine be taken 4-6 weeks after the first dose.",
    },
    {
        ques:"Q: How do we know the vaccine is safe?",
        ans:"A: The most commonly used vaccines we have today have been in use for decades, with millions of people receiving them safely every year. As with all these successful vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines have also undergone extensive and rigorous testing before being approved.  Scientists around the world have been working since early 2020 to develop the current possible COVID-19 vaccines and go through all of the testing processes to ensure they are safe. The vaccine safety is also monitored after the vaccines have been introduced which is called post-market surveillance. This ensures that the vaccines will continue to meet the same quality, safety and performance requirements as when they were initially introduced in the market.",
    },
    {
        ques:"Q: Are risks of COVID-19 vaccination more than its benefits for a pregnant/lactating woman?",
        ans:"A: No, the very real benefits of vaccinating pregnant and lactating women seem to far outweigh any theoretical and remote risks of vaccination. Lactating women are also considered for Covid vaccine as there are no known adverse effects on the neonate who is breastfeeding. In fact, there is a possibility of passage of protective antibodies to the child, which may have a beneficial effect.",
    },
    {
        ques:"Q: Which vaccines should I take if I am pregnant?",
        ans:"A: National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) recommends that pregnant women may take any one of the two Covid-19 vaccines (Covishield or Covaxin). You must consult your doctor about the choice of vaccine in particular case. Both COVISHIELD and COVAXIN can be used during pregnancy or lactation.",
    },
    {
        ques:"Q: What should pregnant woman consider before getting the vaccine?",
        ans:"A: Expectant woman may consider discussing the following with their doctor/health care provider to guide them to make their decision:  Likelihood of exposure to COVID-19, risks of COVID-19 to them and potential risks to her and fetus Benefits of getting vaccinated Information about the type of vaccine and known side effects of the vaccine.",
